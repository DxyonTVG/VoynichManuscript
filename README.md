# VoynichManuscript Page 22r
IST 242 - Dayon McCray

This is a project i produced for the voynich manuscript page 22R. 
This includes dictionaries from 6 different languages 
With a few matches I made out what this page may be about ! (in the notes section)

Languages used were German, Middle English, French, Latin, Italian, Britian 

The most words that were found or atleast traced back to a known langauge was Middle English. 

Findings: 
Turns out that "pol" is short for politician, this originatd in NA in the 1940s but there -->
were obviously politicians, kings, and rules back in the 1400s, At the time they were ruled by many entities!

Olshy is short for Bolshy which whixh orignated in 1918 and is apart of the british English Dictonary -->
Olshy means a person who argues and makes things difficult

Translation 1!!
Pol Olshy = Polticians argues to make something difficult

Fcholy doesnt have any direct meaning and I couldnt find anything on the internet, but with my clues -->
I figure it has something to do with crimes or felonies??

I had to do some digging for shol but turns out it is short for Shoal which means large amount or quantity.
It also has something to do with fish swimming together in formation!

dpchy doesnt have a direct meaning to any known languages but it closely resembled duchy which is -->
a word derived from french's douche' which is derived from latin 'DUX' which means leader!!

Translation 2!!!
Pol Olshy = Polticians argues to make something difficult for crimes commited in large quantities of people with a leader??

Oty means over the year which derives from english military and government!

Thats the most I could make out and is probably the theme of that page.
