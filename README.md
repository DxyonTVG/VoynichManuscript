IST 242 - Dayon McCray

This is a project i produced for the voynich manuscript page 22R. 
This includes dictionaries from 6 different languages 
With a few matches I made out what this page may be about ! (in the notes section)

Languages used were Gernman, Middle English, French, Latin, Italian, Britian 

The most words that were found or atleast traced back to a known langauge was Middle English.
